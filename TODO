-- add boundary conditions definition over nodes (only concentrated forces, displacements were already implemented)
-- add user ramp option for pressure (as it is implemented for dirichlet)
-- add 3D support for nonlinear formulation
-- add convergence criteria for residual in nonlinear model (as it is for linear)
-- add intertial term in residual calculation in linear model
-- check static wave_linear example convergence
